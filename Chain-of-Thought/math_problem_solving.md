# Complex Problem Solving with Chain-of-Thought

## Example 1: Mathematical Reasoning

**Prompt:**
Solve: A restaurant has 23 apples. If they use 3 apples per pie and want to make 7 pies:

How many apples will they use?

How many will remain?

Let's think step by step.


**AI Output:**
Let's break this down step by step:

First, let's calculate how many apples they will use:

They want to make 7 pies

Each pie requires 3 apples

So, the total apples needed = 7 × 3 = 21 apples

Now, let's figure out how many apples will remain:

They started with 23 apples

They will use 21 apples

Remaining apples = 23 - 21 = 2 apples

Therefore:

They will use 21 apples.

2 apples will remain.


## Example 2: Word Problem

**Prompt:**
A train leaves New York at 2:00 PM traveling west at 100 miles per hour. Another train leaves Chicago at 3:00 PM traveling east at 90 miles per hour. If the distance between New York and Chicago is 800 miles, at what time will the trains meet?

Please solve this step-by-step.

**AI Output:**
Let's break this problem down into steps:

Understand the given information:

Train 1: Leaves New York at 2:00 PM, travels west at 100 mph

Train 2: Leaves Chicago at 3:00 PM, travels east at 90 mph

Distance between cities: 800 miles

Train 2 starts 1 hour after Train 1

Calculate the distance Train 1 travels in the first hour:

Distance = Speed × Time

Distance = 100 miles × 1 hour = 100 miles

Calculate the remaining distance when both trains are moving:

Remaining distance = 800 miles - 100 miles = 700 miles

Calculate the combined speed of both trains:

Combined speed = 100 mph + 90 mph = 190 mph

Calculate the time it takes for the trains to meet:

Time = Distance ÷ Speed

Time = 700 miles ÷ 190 mph ≈ 3.68 hours

Convert 0.68 hours to minutes:

0.68 × 60 minutes = 40.8 minutes ≈ 41 minutes

Determine the meeting time:

Trains start moving together at 3:00 PM

They meet after 3 hours and 41 minutes

Meeting time = 3:00 PM + 3:41 = 6:41 PM

Therefore, the trains will meet at approximately 6:41 PM.

This example demonstrates how Chain-of-Thought prompting can guide an AI to solve complex problems by breaking them down into logical steps, enhancing problem-solving capabilities and providing clear, traceable reasoning.
